            <fave> FAVORITE CMSC SUBJECT <br></fave>
            <favorites>
                My favorite is CMSC 56 or the Discrete Mathematical Structures in Computer Science I.<br>
                This because I had fun solving logic, boolean algebra, and linear algebra. I also had <br>
                the chance to teach this subject to freshmen students and others who wanted to take <br>
                CMSC 56 that is why this is also the most familiar CMSC subject for me. Though I took <br>
                this online, I still enjoyed it. <br><br><br>

            <fave> FAVORITE GE SUBJECT <br></fave>
            <favorites>
                My favorite General Education (GE) course is probably Ethics 1. I also took this GE <br>
                subject online. I expected this subject to have a lot of readings and essays but the <br>
                instructor made the workload light. He also prepared a study material that we could <br>
                browse and read that has brief discussion of the topics and his drawings. I enjoyed <br>
                the subject because it made me see things differently. From that GE subject, I now <br>
                value things in my life more. <br><br><br>

            <favorites>
                My favorite programming language so far is Java because of the project in CMSC 22. <br>
                Though I had difficulties at times in creating the project, I still had fun in <br>
                exploring GUI. I also like Java because it can be used in developing and designing <br>
                applications, which are works that I am considering on pursuing after college. <br>
                For me, it is also easier to code in Java using OOP because of its main principles. <br><br><br>

        <fave> FAVORITE FOOD <br></fave>
        <favorites>
            My favorite food is chicken curry because I love how it can seem like a complex dish but <br>
            it is easy to cook. This is also my comfort food especially when it is eaten with hot rice. <br>
            Chicken curry is also one of the first dishes that my mother taught me when I was a kid. <br>
